The Dronecode Camera Server (a.k.a., *Camera Streaming Daemon* - CSD) is an extensible Linux camera server for interfacing any camera with the Dronecode platform.

CSD can connect to multiple cameras and provides access to them via the [MAVLink Camera Protocol](https://mavlink.io/en/protocol/camera.html) and RTSP video streams (it can also advertise available RTSP streams).

Out of the box the CSD connects to cameras that support the [Video4Linux (V4L2) API](https://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/uapi/v4l/v4l2.html) and can also provide access to a camera running within a Gazebo simulation. The CSD has an extensible back-end that can be used to support other types of cameras and also new front-end protocols.

> **Tip** The daemon is the easiest way for Camera OEMs to interface with the Dronecode Platform. Many cameras will just work "out of the box". At most, OEMs may need extend the backend to support their own Linux camera interface.
