# Build & Run the Camera Streaming Daemon

This topic explains how to setup and run the *Camera Streaming Daemon* (CSD) on a Linux computer.

The build system follows a typical *configure > build > install cycle*. The [configuration](#configure) step allows you enable/disable specific features in the build, thereby choosing the combination of features that best-fit your requirements.

> **Tip** We recommend you read this topic as it fully explains the build process. The *Quickstart* topics (see sidebar) provide additional instructions for setting up common configurations.

## Prerequisites

The CSD can be configured to enable/disable specific functionality at compile-time. As a result, some dependencies are only required in order to use specific features. 

The following packages are needed to compile CSD with core functionality (RTSP streaming and MAVLink support):

- Autoconf and libtool (for build configuration)
- GCC/G++ compiler 4.9 or newer
- C and C++ standard libraries
- [GLib](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GLib) 2.42 or newer 
- [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) 1.4 or newer 
- [GStreamer RTSP Server](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/gst-rtsp-server.html) 1.4 or newer 
- Python 2

Optional packages include:
- [Avahi](https://github.com/lathiat/avahi) 0.6 to enable publishing what RTSP streams are available.
- [RealSense](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/distribution_linux.md#installing-the-packages) to support the Intel RealSense 3D Camera.
- [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) in order to enable a simulated camera within the Gazebo environment.


## Installing Prerequisites on Ubuntu

The following sections show how to install the required packages on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

<span id="core_deps"></span>
### Core Dependencies

The core dependencies are required to build CSD with MAVLink and RTSP video streaming support.
```sh
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install git autoconf libtool python-pip -y
sudo apt-get install gstreamer-1.0 \
    libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
    libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev -y
# Required python packages
sudo pip2 -q install -U future
```

> **Note** GCC 5.4 and the C/C++ standard libraries are installed by default.


<span id="avahi_deps"></span>
### Avahi

Run the following command to get the [Avahi](https://github.com/lathiat/avahi) dependencies:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libavahi-client-dev libavahi-core-dev libavahi-glib-dev -y
```

<span id="realsense_deps"></span>
### RealSense 3D Camera

Run the following command to get the [RealSense SDK 1](https://software.intel.com/sites/products/realsense/intro/getting_started.html) libraries:
```
echo 'deb "http://realsense-alm-public.s3.amazonaws.com/apt-repo" xenial main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/realsense-latest.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key D6FB2970 
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt-get install librealsense-dev -y
```

<!-- What are runtime dependencies? https://github.com/intel/camera-streaming-daemon/issues/124 -->

> **Note** The RealSense 2 SDK is not supported. 

<span></span>
> **Note** CSD only has access to this camera when it is **not being used** for optical flow or VIO)

<span id="gazebo_deps"></span>
### Gazebo

The easiest way to set up Gazebo and the PX4 simulator to use the *PX4 Developer Guide* scripts: [Development Environment on Linux > jMAVSim/Gazebo Simulation](https://dev.px4.io/en/setup/dev_env_linux.html#jmavsimgazebo-simulation).


### Get the Source Code

Clone the [camera-streaming-daemon](https://github.com/intel/camera-streaming-daemon) repo (or your fork):
```sh
git clone https://github.com/intel/camera-streaming-daemon.git
cd camera-streaming-daemon
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This fetches all the sources for the project (including the [MAVLink C library](https://mavlink.io/en/) submodule, which is generated by the build system during compilation).

> **Note** Alternatively you can do this in one line:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/intel/camera-streaming-daemon.git --recursive
  ```


## Configure

Configuration allows you to specify the features that will be included when CSD is compiled (this step need only be done once).

The full configuration syntax is given below:
```sh
./autogen.sh && ./configure [--enable-mavlink] [--enable-aero] [--enable-avahi] [--enable-gazebo]
```

The optional configuration options enable specific functionality at compile-time:
* `--enable-aero`: Enables aero-specific bottom bottom facing VGA camera (OV7251 sensor for optical flow/VIO).
* `--enable-realsense`: Enables Intel RealSense 3D Camera.
* `--enable-avahi`: Enables Avahi to advertise the list of available RTSP streams.
* `--enable-mavlink`: Enables MAVLink [Camera Protocol](https://mavlink.io/en/protocol/camera.html) support.
* `--enable-gazebo`: Enables Gazebo camera.

In addition, CSD generates the file **csd.service** by default (see [Auto-start CSD](../guide/autostart.md)). File generation can be disabled/configured using:
* `--disable-systemd`: Disable *systemd* support (i.e. on systems where *systemd* is not present).
* `--with-systemdsystemunitdir <path>`: Set the *systemd* system directory to `<path>` (Default is taken from **pkg-config**).

The configuration step will fail gracefully if any [dependency](#dependencies) required by the specified configuration is not available.
At the end of the configuration process the system will output a report showing what additional features are enabled: 
```
RealSense support:   yes
MAVLink support:     yes
AVAHI support:       no
Intel Aero support:  no
Gazebo support:      no
```


## Build

After configuration, build the CSD using *make*:
```
make
```

The *csd* executable will be created in the root of your CSD source tree (along with the Intel Aero CSD startup file: **csd.service**).

## Run

The line below shows how to start CSD, specifying a [CSD Configuration File](../guide/configuration_file.md) (in this case the Ubuntu **.conf** file in the source tree):
```
./csd -c samples/files/ubuntu.conf
```

> **Tip** The [samples/files](https://github.com/intel/camera-streaming-daemon/tree/master/samples/files) directory contains sample [configuration files](../guide/configuration_file.md) that you can use to set up CSD for use on Ubuntu, Aero and other platforms. To use a sample file, copy it to **/etc/csd/main.conf**, specify it in the `CSD_CONF_FILE` environment variable, or set the `-c` switch when starting CSD.

Other command line options can be displayed using the `-h` flag:
```sh
$ ./csd -h
csd [OPTIONS...]

  -c --conf-file                   .conf file with configurations for camera-streaming-daemon.
  -d --conf-dir <dir>              Directory where to look for .conf files overriding
                                   default conf file.
  -g --debug-log-level <level>     Set debug log level. Levels are
                                   <error|warning|notice|info|debug>
  -v --verbose                     Verbose. Same as --debug-log-level=debug
  -h --help                        Print this message
```

> **Note** CSD can also be started automatically on boot. This is discussed in [Quickstart â€” Intel Aero](../getting_started/quick_start_intel_aero.md) and [Autostart CSD](../guide/autostart.md).


## Sanity Tests

After installing CSD, use the [Sanity Tests](sanity_tests.md) to verify that CSD is working correctly.
